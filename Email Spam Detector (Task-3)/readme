Email Spam Detector
This project is a Python-based email spam detector that uses machine learning to classify emails as either spam or non-spam. The dataset used for this project is the SMS Spam Collection dataset from Kaggle.

Installation
To run this project, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NLTK
You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk

Usage
!.Clone this repository to your local machine.

2.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3.Run the email_spam_detector.py script to train the machine learning model and save it to a file:

python email_spam_detector.py

4.Once the model is saved, you can use it to classify new emails by running the classify_emails.py script:

python classify_emails.py <input_file> <output_file>

<input_file> is the path to a CSV file containing the emails to classify. The file should have two columns: text and label. text contains the email text, and label is the actual class of the email (spam or ham).
<output_file> is the path to a CSV file where the classified emails will be saved. The file will have three columns: text, label, and predicted_label. text contains the email text, label is the actual class of the email, and predicted_label is the predicted class of the email (spam or ham).

Future Work
Experiment with different machine learning models and see which one works best for this dataset.
Use more advanced natural language processing techniques to improve the accuracy of the model.
Build a web interface for the email spam detector so that users can classify emails without having to run the scripts manually.
