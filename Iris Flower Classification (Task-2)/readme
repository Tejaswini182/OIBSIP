Iris Flower Classification
This project is a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which contains 150 instances of iris flowers with measurements of their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is available in scikit-learn's built-in datasets module.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

Usage
To run the machine learning model, run the following command:
python iris_classification.py

This will train the model on the Iris dataset and output the results.

Model Evaluation
The performance of the machine learning model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Results
The machine learning model achieves an accuracy of 0.97 on the Iris dataset. The results are visualized using a confusion matrix and classification report.

Conclusion
In this project, I built a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The model achieved high accuracy on the Iris dataset, and could be used to classify new iris flowers with high accuracy as well.
